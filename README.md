# coopdx-patcher

coopdx-patcher is a small program by Agent X that can output an sm64coopdx executable in ***seconds***.

It is written in C#, using .NET Framework 4.7, allowing it to be compatible with older computers.

# How It Works

coopdx-patcher uses the same method of executable creation the sm64ex-alo PC Port rom hacks used. The compiled binary is made into a patch file that applies to the US ROM. When we store these patch files on the internet (which are only roughly 30 MB) they can simply be downloaded and applied to the ROM, the patcher handles that, DLLs AND grabbing the resource files (dynos, mods and lang) making getting sm64coopdx very fast and easy.
